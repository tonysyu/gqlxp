## Dependency Categories

When assessing a proposed refactor for deepening, classify its dependencies:

### 1. In-process

Pure computation, in-memory state, no I/O. Always deepenable — just merge the modules and test directly.

### 2. Local-substitutable

Dependencies that have local test stand-ins (e.g., in-memory Bleve index for search, temp directory for filesystem). Deepenable if the test substitute exists. The deepened module is tested with the local stand-in running in the test suite.

## Testing Strategy

The core principle: **replace, don't layer.**

- Old unit tests on shallow modules are waste once boundary tests exist — delete them
- Write new tests at the deepened module's interface boundary
- Tests assert on observable outcomes through the public interface, not internal state
- Tests should survive internal refactors — they describe behavior, not implementation
