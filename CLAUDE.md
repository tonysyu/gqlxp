# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION RULE

**ALL documentation relevant to developers and users MUST be placed in either:**
- `README.md` for project overview and getting started information
- `docs/*` for detailed technical documentation

**CLAUDE.md is exclusively for AI instructions and should NOT contain user/developer documentation.**

## DOCUMENTATION CONSISTENCY RULE

**When discovering inconsistencies between code and documentation:**
- ALWAYS suggest updating the relevant documentation files (`README.md` or `docs/*`) to reflect current code state
- Proactively identify outdated information in documentation during code analysis
- Suggest specific documentation updates rather than just noting the inconsistency

## Project Information

- [README.md](README.md) - Project overview and getting started
- [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) - Build, test, and development commands
